#Constructor-Word-Guess App 
This is my second node application. 
##How to Use 
Open this app in the command line and it will prompt 
you to enter input. It will randomly select a word 
from a pre-determined list of words and display the 
blank letter spaces of that word for you. You have 
twelve guesses to guess the word correctly (correct 
guesses and guesses that have already been guessed 
do not count). If you guess the word correctly, or 
if you run out of guesses, the app will give you an 
opportunity to play again. 
##Notes 
Make sure to install the dependencies in the 
package.json. The app will not work with them.
